# Learning Goals: 
Gain competency with React fundamentals, Test React components & asynchronous JS, Practice refactoring, Create a multi-page UX using Router

# Wins + Challenges: 
- Getting the Genre dropdown to work properly was a challenge, as it required two separate API calls to render all the initial movie cards with both a single movie and genre availability for the user. 
- This project was my first attempt at using Glide.js to implement the slide carousel modal. I was happy to implement that library. 
- Cypress testing for this app was a bit tougher than expected due to the separate API calls for all the movie cards, but it was a unique challenge and a great learning experience.
